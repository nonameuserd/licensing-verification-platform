# Competitor Brief — Credly (short)

Summary

- Credly is a broad digital credentialing platform (by Pearson) focused on training providers, employers, and workforce insights. Large issuer network, high volume, rich metadata, analytics, and integrations.

How we differ (snapshot)

- Focus: We target regulated licensing boards (medical, legal, engineering) and employers who need authoritative, legally-significant verification. Credly targets learning providers and employers for skills/badges.
- Proof model: We use ZKPs + optional on-chain registry for privacy-preserving, tamper-evident verification. Credly uses a centralized badge platform with rich metadata.
- Compliance: We prioritize regulatory compliance (HIPAA-ready flows, audit trails, signed artifacts). Credly emphasizes enterprise security but not board-level regulatory workflows by default.

Feature comparison (high level)

- Authoritative licensing verification: Us = yes (boards as primary issuers); Credly = limited
- Privacy-preserving proofs (ZKP): Us = yes; Credly = no
- On-chain tamper evidence: Us = optional/yes; Credly = no
- Workforce analytics & discoverability: Us = limited; Credly = strong
- Large issuer marketplace: Us = niche/vertical; Credly = broad & mature

Pricing comparison (positioning)

- Our model (verification-first): per-verification fees ($0.10–$2 range), board enterprise subscriptions ($10K–$50K/mo), paid PoCs ($25K). Designed for mission-critical, high-trust checks.
- Credly model: platform/subscription for issuers, add-ons for analytics and integrations; optimized for volume of badges and employer discovery.

Common objections and rebuttals (sales-ready)

- Objection: "Credly already issues credentials at scale — why switch?"
  - Rebuttal: Credly is optimized for learning and badges. For regulated licensing you need legal provenance, auditability, and privacy guarantees we provide (ZKPs, signed artifacts, SLAs).
- Objection: "This sounds complex (ZKPs, on-chain)."
  - Rebuttal: We package complexity behind simple APIs, dashboards, and a paid PoC that proves integration without long-term risk. We provide compliance docs and a security audit.
- Objection: "We already have a credentialing partner."
  - Rebuttal: Existing partners rarely offer regulatory-grade verification with privacy controls. Offer a targeted pilot to demonstrate time and cost saved in verification and audit workflows.

Top sales talk tracks

- To Boards: "Reduce verification overhead and exposure risk — provide employers with instant, legally-authoritative verification while preserving candidate privacy and meeting regulatory audit requirements."
- To Employers/Hospitals: "Cut multi-day manual verification to 30s via API. Receive auditable, board-signed verification without exposing exam or medical data."
- To Background-Check Partners: "Offer richer, authoritative license checks as an API add-on — increase lead conversion and reduce manual phone/email verification costs."

Quick competitive playbook

- Publish 1–2 board case studies and a concise security audit PDF. Use these as the primary objections-handling asset.
- Prioritize integration partnerships (Checkr, Sterling) to get distribution and credibility fast.
- Keep messaging simple: "Authoritative. Private. Instant." — contrasted with Credly: "Broad. Discoverable. Analytic."
