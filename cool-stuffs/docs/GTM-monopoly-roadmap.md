# GTM & Monopoly Roadmap — 12 Months

## The Monopoly Thesis: "Verifiable Credential Infrastructure for Professional Licensing"

### "We built the first blockchain verification platform that makes professional credential verification as fast as a credit card transaction." 'Stripe for Professional Credentials'

**eliminates the $50-200 cost per credential verification**

**Objective**: Become the canonical verification layer for professional licensing boards (medical, legal, engineering, financial services) by combining ZKPs for privacy-preserving credential verification, web-based platform, and on-chain credential registry.

**Core Value Proposition**:

- **Privacy-preserving verification**: ZKPs prove credential validity without revealing sensitive exam data
- **Web-based platform**: Easy-to-use web interface for licensing boards and employers
- **Instant employer verification**: On-chain credentials enable real-time verification without board contact
- **Regulatory compliance**: Built-in audit trails and compliance features for licensing boards
- **Optional document verification**: Basic authenticity checks for premium customers

## Why This Creates a Monopoly

**Network Effects**: Once licensing boards adopt your system, they become locked in because:

- Employers can instantly verify credentials without contacting the board
- Cross-board verification becomes seamless
- The cost of switching increases exponentially

**Regulatory Moat**: Professional licensing is heavily regulated. Early adoption creates:

- Compliance advantages that competitors can't easily replicate
- Relationships with regulatory bodies
- Legal precedent that favors your approach

**Technical Moat**: Your combination of ZKPs + web-based verification + on-chain registry is extremely hard to replicate:

- ZKPs ensure privacy while maintaining verifiability
- Web-based platform provides easy access and integration
- On-chain registry provides tamper-proof verification

## Target Customers & Partners (Ordered by Monopoly Potential)

1. **State Medical Boards** (highest priority — physician licensing, $2B+ market)
2. **Bar Associations** (lawyer licensing, $1B+ market)
3. **Engineering Licensing Boards** (PE licensing, $500M+ market)
4. **Financial Services Licensing** (FINRA, SEC, $300M+ market)
5. **Background Check Companies** (distribution partners — Checkr, Sterling)
6. **HR Tech Platforms** (integration partners — Workday, BambooHR)

## Revenue Model (Verification-First)

- $0.50-$2.00 per credential verification (scales with board size)
- $0.10-$0.25 per verification for employer API access

**Enterprise Subscriptions**:

- Partner with 2 major hospital systems for employer verification
- Create developer onboarding docs + sample integrations
- Begin legal/engineering licensing board outreach

**KPIs**: 1 medical board conversion to paid contract, 500+ verifications on-chain, 2 hospital system integrations

### Q3 — Legal/Engineering Board Expansion & Network Effects (Jul-Sep 2025)

**Engineering**:

- Improve document verification system with basic authenticity checks
- Harden identity/bind flows (email/ID verification + optional KYC integration)
- Add multi-tenant admin UI for licensing boards
- Create legal/engineering board verification circuits

**GTM**:

- Close 1-2 additional medical board contracts; launch 1 legal board pilot
- Integrate with 1 major background check company (Checkr/Sterling)
- Publish medical board case study + security audit report
- Begin engineering licensing board outreach

**KPIs**: 3 paying customers, 1,000+ verifications/day, $25K+ ARPC

### Q4 — Platform Dominance & Monopoly Lock-in (Oct-Dec 2025)

**Engineering**:

- Versioned API + SLA; SDK maturity v1; expand registry to multi-issuer trust graph
- Operationalize artifact signing + provenance for circuits (makes copying harder)
- Create cross-board verification system (medical + legal + engineering)
- Implement advanced document verification for premium customers

**GTM**:

- Launch partner program (background check companies, HR tech platforms)
- Secure exclusive reseller deals with 2 major background check companies
- Close 1 engineering licensing board contract
- Begin international expansion planning (Canada, UK medical boards)

**KPIs**: 5+ paying customers, 5,000+ verifications/day, <5% churn, 3+ exclusive partnerships

## Success Criteria (12 Months)

**Customer Metrics**:

- At least 5 paid licensing board customers, each with $25K+ ARPC
- 1 major background check company integration (Checkr/Sterling)
- 2+ hospital system employer integrations

**Technical Metrics**:

- 5,000+ verifications recorded on-chain per day
- 99.9% API uptime with signed SLA contracts
- Versioned ZK artifacts + signed installer provenance

**Market Position**:

- Clear defensibility: regulatory relationships + technical moat + network effects
- At least 3 exclusive pilot agreements with 90-day terms
- Published case studies from 2+ licensing boards

## Top Risks & Mitigations

**Regulatory/Privacy Pushback**:

- Risk: HIPAA/medical licensing compliance issues
- Mitigation: Privacy-by-Design architecture, minimal data retention, legal review before pilots, SOC2 compliance roadmap

**Competitive Response**:

- Risk: Large incumbents (Pearson, Prometric) copying approach
- Mitigation: Fast partner rollout to lock demand, exclusive pilot agreements, technical moat (ZKPs + AI)

**Technical Complexity**:

- Risk: ZKP circuit complexity, AI model accuracy
- Mitigation: Continuous improvements, forensic exports, human review fallback, versioned artifacts

**Distribution Failure**:

- Risk: Licensing boards prefer existing vendors
- Mitigation: Focus on one narrow vertical (medical), create concentrated network effects, regulatory relationship building

## Immediate Next Steps (First 30 Days)

**Week 1: Technical Foundation**

1. Implement `quotaMiddleware.ts` with Redis-backed per-org quotas for verification endpoints
2. Create medical board pilot package materials (compliance checklist, security audit, SLA terms)

3. Implement `quotaMiddleware.ts` with Redis-backed per-org quotas for verification endpoints
4. Create medical board pilot package materials (compliance checklist, security audit, SLA terms)
5. Begin wiring verification-only API contracts and admin flows (no exam delivery)

**Week 2: CI & Artifacts** 4. Add CI pipeline job `yarn compile-circuits` to produce signed, versioned ZK artifacts 5. Build web-based admin dashboard for credential management 6. Create medical board verification API contract & documentation

**Week 3: GTM Preparation** 7. Update pilot materials to emphasize verification-first approach with medical board focus 8. Identify 3 target state medical boards (CA, TX, NY) and begin outreach 9. Create regulatory compliance documentation for HIPAA/medical licensing

**Week 4: Pilot Launch** 10. Launch first medical board pilot outreach with $25K paid PoC offer 11. Set up quota system to protect pilots and gate unpaid usage 12. Begin hospital system employer verification API development

## The Monopoly Endgame

In 3-5 years, become the **"Stripe of Professional Credentials"** — the infrastructure layer that every licensing board uses and every employer trusts. Competitors can't enter because:

- **Regulatory relationships**: Deep partnerships with medical, legal, and engineering boards
- **Technical moat**: ZKPs + web-based verification + on-chain registry combination is extremely hard to replicate
- **Network effects**: Boards → employers → more boards creates exponential value
- **Switching costs**: Integrated verification systems make migration prohibitively expensive
