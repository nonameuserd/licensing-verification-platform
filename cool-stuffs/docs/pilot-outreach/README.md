# Pilot Outreach Docs

This folder contains collateral to run paid pilots with certification boards and L&D partners.

Files:

- `pilot-package.md` — what we deliver in a pilot
- `pilot-security-PII-checklist.md` — security and privacy checklist for pilots
- `pilot-contract-template.md` — high-level contract/template items (non-legal)
- `pilot-success-criteria.md` — measurable acceptance and KPI definitions
- `outreach-email-templates.md` — email templates for outreach and follow-ups

Use these as living documents. Update them after each pilot and store signed agreements in the project vault.
