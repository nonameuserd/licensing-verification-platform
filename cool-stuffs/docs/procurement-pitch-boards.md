# 2-Slide Pitch — Board Procurement (condensed)

Slide 1 — Risk, Compliance, and Impact

- Title: "Compliance-first Verification for Licensing Boards"
- Problem: Manual verification is slow, error-prone, and creates privacy exposure and audit gaps.
- Solution: A privacy-preserving, auditable verification platform designed specifically for licensing boards.
- Key benefits:
  - Regulatory-ready audit trails (full provenance and retention controls)
  - HIPAA-aware data flows and SOC2 alignment
  - Cryptographic proofs (ZKPs) that validate license status without exposing sensitive exam data
  - SLA-backed uptime and enterprise support
- Impact (quantified): Reduce manual verification cost by X% (use pilot to determine exact number); time-to-verify from days → <1 minute; stronger evidence in enforcement and disciplinary workflows.

Slide 2 — Contracting, Security, and Pilot

- Title: "How we work with Boards — Pilot → Production"
- Pilot overview: 90-day paid PoC ($25K) — includes 1,000 verifications, dedicated engineering support, compliance checklist, and optional short-term exclusivity.
- Security & compliance:
  - Signed security audit (attach PDF)
  - Data processing addendum & HIPAA controls
  - Role-based access, audit logging, and retention controls
- SLA & support:
  - 99.9% API uptime target with options for higher SLAs
  - Enterprise onboarding and dedicated account manager
  - Escalation & incident response playbook
- Next steps: Sign PoC MOU → Integration window (2–4 weeks) → Pilot go-live → Board evaluation and enterprise contract negotiation.
