# Landing page copy — Licensing Boards

Headline
"Authoritative. Private. Instant. — Digital verification built for licensing boards."

Subhead
Give employers instant, legally-authoritative verification without exposing sensitive candidate data. Reduce verification workload, maintain audit trails, and meet regulatory requirements.

Why this matters

- Boards are responsible for public safety and legal compliance. Our platform preserves privacy using zero-knowledge proofs while delivering tamper-evident, auditable verification to employers and background-check partners.

Primary benefits

- Reduce verification calls and emails — instant API-based checks for employers
- Preserve candidate privacy — ZK proofs prove license validity without exposing exam data
- Regulatory-ready audit logs and SLA-backed uptime
- Signed artifacts and provenance — cryptographic evidence for disputes

How it works (3 steps)

1. Board issues a signed, privacy-preserving credential.
2. Employer or background-check partner calls our API to request verification.
3. We return a signed verification assertion + audit record in <1 minute.
