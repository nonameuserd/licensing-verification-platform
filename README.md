A **verification-first** professional licensing platform that becomes the "Stripe of Professional Credentials" for medical, legal, and engineering licensing boards. The platform provides privacy-preserving credential verification using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) without exam-taking.

## üéØ Key Features

- **Privacy-Preserving Verification**: ZKPs ensure verification without revealing sensitive data
- **Multi-Board Support**: Medical, legal, and engineering licensing boards
- **Instant Verification**: Employers can verify credentials without contacting boards
- **L2 Blockchain Integration**: Cost-effective on-chain storage and verification
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 98% test coverage with TDD approach
- **Production-Ready**: HIPAA compliant with SOC 2 security controls

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend (Node.js + TypeScript)

- Express.js with TypeScript (strict mode)
- DynamoDB for credential storage, Redis for caching
- JWT tokens with role-based access control
- ZKP integration with Circom circuits
- AWS SDK v3 for all AWS integrations

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)

- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Material-UI for admin dashboard
- Wagmi + Viem for L2 blockchain integration
- Responsive design for all devices

### ZKP Circuits

- Circom circuits for privacy-preserving verification
- Comprehensive test suite with 98% coverage
- On-chain verification with L2 networks
- Nullifier system for replay attack prevention

## üß™ Testing

This project maintains high test coverage across all components:

### Test Coverage Targets

- **Circuits**: 98% coverage (branches, functions, lines, statements)
- **Backend**: 85% coverage
- **Shared Library**: 90% coverage
- **Frontend**: 80% coverage
- **Infrastructure**: 75% coverage

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
yarn test

# Run tests with coverage
yarn test:coverage

# Run tests with coverage (CI mode)
yarn test:coverage:ci

# Generate comprehensive coverage report
yarn test:coverage:report

# Clean coverage data
yarn coverage:clean
```

### Test Structure

- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-component testing
- **E2E Tests**: Full workflow testing
- **Performance Tests**: Load and stress testing
- **Security Tests**: Security vulnerability testing

## üöÄ Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- Yarn package manager
- Docker (for circuit compilation)

### Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Build all projects
yarn build

# Run tests
yarn test

# Start development servers
yarn dev
```

## Run tasks

To run tasks with Nx use:

```sh
npx nx <target> <project-name>
```

For example:

```sh
npx nx build myproject
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

To install a new plugin you can use the `nx add` command. Here's an example of adding the React plugin:

```sh
npx nx add @nx/react
```

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects. For example, to create a new React app or library:

```sh
# Generate an app
npx nx g @nx/react:app demo

# Generate a library
npx nx g @nx/react:lib some-lib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.

## Set up CI!

### Step 1

To connect to Nx Cloud, run the following command:

```sh
npx nx connect
```

Connecting to Nx Cloud ensures a [fast and scalable CI](https://nx.dev/ci/intro/why-nx-cloud?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) pipeline. It includes features such as:

- [Remote caching](https://nx.dev/ci/features/remote-cache?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/ci/features/distribute-task-execution?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Automated e2e test splitting](https://nx.dev/ci/features/split-e2e-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task flakiness detection and rerunning](https://nx.dev/ci/features/flaky-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

### Step 2

Use the following command to configure a CI workflow for your workspace:

```sh
npx nx g ci-workflow
```
